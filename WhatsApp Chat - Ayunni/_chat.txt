[12/06/2025, 6:54:57 PM] Ayunni: Tak sure, kwn dia yg arrange. Hopefully tak jauh sgt
[12/06/2025, 6:55:43 PM] Ayunni: Have you ever thought about trying different role somewhere else that might suit you better?
[12/06/2025, 6:56:28 PM] Ayunni: Hmm, dont you think you might need sometime for yourself? 😊
[12/06/2025, 7:59:18 PM] Ayunni: Hey, sorry spam whatsapp 😅 Back to your question, honestly, I’d love to meet u too. Idk why, but im comfortable dgn u, ada good vibe. Tapi… i think i just need a bit more time. I takut to get emotionally invested too soon. I jenis yang once i falI i go all in. So i hope u don’t mind kalau i slow sikit. Pastu, bila i cakap - u should keep your options open, i meant it. I faham kalau u ada your own timeline or plan nak ada life partner. Kalau u jumpa someone else yang align dengan tu, i won’t take it personally.

I just really enjoy getting to know u. I hope we can keep this going, at a pace that feels right for both of us. ‎<This message was edited>

[12/06/2025, 8:30:35 PM] Amir Ariff: Hey, thanks so much for being so open - I really love this side of you. I’m totally happy to take things slow, and aside from work and my kids in Kelantan I don’t have much else vying for my attention.

I only installed bumble this past Sunday (blame the 12-hour KB–KL road trip.. I really should’ve flown 😅). I’ll probably delete the app soon; it just feels weird texting other people. Maybe that’s just how I was raised.

I don’t have a concrete timeline yet, but I do want a life partner someday. I know it won’t come easily - if it did, it probably wouldn’t be the right one, as I’ve learned from my previous marriage.

Like you, I really enjoy our vibe and your personality, and I’d love to keep this going. I look forward to your messages every day - they’ve quickly become the highlight of my whatsapp 😁
[12/06/2025, 8:30:45 PM] Amir Ariff: Woohoo!

[13/06/2025, 10:23:12 PM] Amir Ariff: Also tried sashimi etc. oh man really need to exercise
[13/06/2025, 10:25:26 PM] Ayunni: To be honest, ranting phase da lepas. Hahaha. I dah tak fikir pun skrg. Dulu, i selalu ada prasaan - knp org yg buat salah boleh hidup mcm biasa like sikit pun takda rs bersalah? Why the one the being hurt yg struggle? Terbalik.
[13/06/2025, 10:25:40 PM] Ayunni: He was caught cheating with someone’s wife
[13/06/2025, 10:26:43 PM] Ayunni: His sister and i findout, and his sister helped me to get him come clean lol
[13/06/2025, 10:27:25 PM] Ayunni: I have all the proof
[13/06/2025, 10:28:03 PM] Amir Ariff: Alhamdulillah at least you dah tak fikir pun skrg. It’s because of the trauma, you never expected that to happen and were shocked to find out.
[13/06/2025, 10:28:10 PM] Ayunni: And i still rapat dgn adik dia smpai skrg
[13/06/2025, 10:28:24 PM] Amir Ariff: I see well that’s good
[13/06/2025, 10:28:44 PM] Amir Ariff: If you don’t mind me asking how long is your relationship with him?
[13/06/2025, 10:29:02 PM] Ayunni: 13 years ahhahahhah since i study lg
[13/06/2025, 10:29:44 PM] Ayunni: I tak nampak he doesnt want to commit, i try to understand dia struggle financially
[13/06/2025, 10:29:56 PM] Amir Ariff: Understand so that’s why. No worries you moved on and its the past
[13/06/2025, 10:30:36 PM] Amir Ariff: We embrace and learn from the past to be present
[13/06/2025, 10:31:14 PM] Ayunni: Yeah, bila i ingt balik, how defensive i am when my friends told me he might has someone else, i malu 😂
[13/06/2025, 10:31:17 PM] Ayunni: Hahahhaha
[13/06/2025, 10:32:11 PM] Amir Ariff: I see I can understand that
[13/06/2025, 10:33:05 PM] Ayunni: Sorry, baru ckp da lepas ranting phase ahhahah words tak align with action 😂
[13/06/2025, 10:33:20 PM] Amir Ariff: Hey no worries!
[13/06/2025, 10:33:25 PM] Amir Ariff: Please do continue
[13/06/2025, 10:34:02 PM] Ayunni: Malu laaa, mcm cerita how stupid i am 🙃
[13/06/2025, 10:34:02 PM] Amir Ariff: I mean i dont what made up words i make but just trying to comfort you
[13/06/2025, 10:36:36 PM] Amir Ariff: Yun, you’re not stupid. You did your best as a human — being kind, loyal, and true to your feelings.
[13/06/2025, 10:36:47 PM] Amir Ariff: Dont lose yourself because of a man
[13/06/2025, 10:38:05 PM] Amir Ariff: He’s definitely not even on your level — don’t ever lower your worth for someone like that.
[13/06/2025, 10:38:25 PM] Amir Ariff: One day you’ll look back and be proud of how far you’ve come from this.
[13/06/2025, 10:39:22 PM] Ayunni: I just feel like i wasted my time, made a wrong choice. 13 yrs wasted mcm tu je. Tiba2 i 33 and single 😂
[13/06/2025, 10:39:36 PM] Amir Ariff: This definitely doesnt define you. It only proves how much you are capable of loving and trusting.. thats powerful.
[13/06/2025, 10:40:21 PM] Amir Ariff: No not wasted never think that way.
[13/06/2025, 10:40:56 PM] Amir Ariff: I also 5 yrs marriage and been cheated two times 😂
[13/06/2025, 10:41:41 PM] Amir Ariff: But i wont say im stupid. I feel glad that i knew it earlier then continue it longer
[13/06/2025, 10:41:59 PM] Amir Ariff: Of course the heartbreaks and all tu ada but i think thats just a phase
[13/06/2025, 10:43:27 PM] Amir Ariff: And it’s also with someone’s husband whose wife is pregnant. I mean im not trying to paint a bad picture of my ex but it does happen and lesson to me
[13/06/2025, 10:43:42 PM] Ayunni: Yeke? When he chose someone’s wife over me - it make me question my worth. Apa yg kurang, apa yg salah.
[13/06/2025, 10:43:59 PM] Amir Ariff: The right person will never make you feel like you have to question your worth.
[13/06/2025, 10:44:15 PM] Amir Ariff: I did feel this too
[13/06/2025, 10:44:35 PM] Amir Ariff: And cried haha.. oh man malu plk share this to you
[13/06/2025, 10:45:24 PM] Amir Ariff: I did all i could, given her everything and even took part time jobs. But yeah shes  not the right person
[13/06/2025, 10:45:34 PM] Ayunni: Actually i sense something when u take care of your kids, she gave them to u ‎<This message was edited>
[13/06/2025, 10:45:41 PM] Amir Ariff: So dont feel that your worth is anything lower
[13/06/2025, 10:46:25 PM] Amir Ariff: Yeah and i took care of my second alone when she had postpartum depression. Took long leaves and working from home.
[13/06/2025, 10:46:33 PM] Amir Ariff: Waking up etc.
[13/06/2025, 10:46:36 PM] Ayunni: Did the wife find out?
[13/06/2025, 10:46:41 PM] Amir Ariff: Because he was still baby
[13/06/2025, 10:47:51 PM] Amir Ariff: I dont know she confessed it to me and beg for another chance. I have no time to find out about the wife with kids and work.
[13/06/2025, 10:48:03 PM] Ayunni: 2 times, orang yg sama ke? If u re not comfortable to share , its okay
[13/06/2025, 10:48:42 PM] Ayunni: Mcm mna dia boleh confess?
[13/06/2025, 10:48:47 PM] Amir Ariff: Then given another chance, he was caught went to penang with diffferent guy who is his old friend. She told me she went with her mom
[13/06/2025, 10:48:53 PM] Ayunni: U okay tak kalau i tnya bnyk? 😂
[13/06/2025, 10:48:57 PM] Amir Ariff: And her mom share the pic to me😂
[13/06/2025, 10:49:09 PM] Amir Ariff: So that was the last straw
[13/06/2025, 10:49:22 PM] Amir Ariff: It happen about 2 months after the first incident
[13/06/2025, 10:49:37 PM] Amir Ariff: Out of the blue
[13/06/2025, 10:50:01 PM] Amir Ariff: I dont know how but could be im asking questions
[13/06/2025, 10:50:05 PM] Amir Ariff: Dah tak igt dah
[13/06/2025, 10:50:16 PM] Amir Ariff: But yeah she told me she lover him etc.
[13/06/2025, 10:50:28 PM] Amir Ariff: I still kept this as a proof
[13/06/2025, 10:51:01 PM] Amir Ariff: Or if i still have it haha
[13/06/2025, 10:51:14 PM] Amir Ariff: Anyway its the past

[13/06/2025, 10:52:12 PM] Amir Ariff: Its already a bad thing to divorce but not to also keep in touch will be even harder
[13/06/2025, 10:52:16 PM] Ayunni: Is ur ex in kelantan too?
[13/06/2025, 10:52:29 PM] Amir Ariff: For the kids

[14/06/2025, 6:57:53 PM] Ayunni: I see
[14/06/2025, 6:58:11 PM] Amir Ariff: It was a long-distance relationship.. she was in Johor. But I think the real challenge wasn’t the distance, it was more about how impatient she could be. Sometimes, if I didn’t pick up her calls, she’d get upset and say hurtful things. It started to feel suffocating. She also used to say she felt like she was just a rebound. I think she needed a lot of reassurance and attention.. maybe because she was still figuring herself out. And maybe I just wasn’t the right fit for that.

I’ve learned a lot from my past relationships and I just want to grow into someone better each day. That said, I don’t think we should be too hard on ourselves if we stumble sometimes.. what matters is that we learn from it and get better together.

[15/06/2025, 7:15:39 PM] Amir Ariff: Aww, sorry you had to go through that. Being tired and then dealing with car trouble.. anyone would feel overwhelmed. But don’t be too hard on yourself, okay? You’ve always done your best for your family, and sometimes things like this are just out of our control. You’re still the superwoman I know, from all the stories you’ve shared: buying the house, supporting your siblings… you’ve already done so much. 🫡

[20/06/2025, 11:43:47 PM] Ayunni: Tnya laa
[20/06/2025, 11:52:10 PM] Amir Ariff: 🚨 Professionally – What actually annoys or turns you off:
	1.	Micromanagement or lack of trust – You prefer space to own your work and drive results.
	2.	Wasted time or inefficiency – Whether it’s scattered data or unclear task flow, you value clean processes.
	3.	Lack of respect for your time/effort – If you’ve put in the grind, you expect mutual respect or at least acknowledgment.
	4.	People who don’t care about the bigger picture – When team members act like it’s “just a task,” it clashes with your strategic mindset.
5. Hierarchy for the sake of hierarchy
– You’re comfortable navigating leadership, but rigid systems that prioritize politics over impact likely frustrate you.

⸻

😤 Personally – What annoys or turns you off:
	1.	Manipulation or guilt-tripping – You value maturity and authenticity in emotional connections.
	2.	Being interrupted mid-flow – Especially when you’re in creative/productive mode.
	3.	People who push your boundaries or dismiss your values – You have your compass; it’s a red flag when others ignore it.

[21/06/2025, 1:24:18 AM] Amir Ariff: Love is in us

[21/06/2025, 1:25:36 AM] Ayunni: Omg
[21/06/2025, 1:26:06 AM] Amir Ariff: This being human is a guest house.
Every morning a new arrival.

A joy, a depression, a meanness,
some momentary awareness comes
as an unexpected visitor.

Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if they’re a crowd of sorrows,
who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture,
still, treat each guest honorably.
He may be clearing you out
for some new delight.

The dark thought, the shame, the malice,
meet them at the door laughing,
and invite them in.

Be grateful for whoever comes,
because each has been sent
as a guide from beyond.

[22/06/2025, 1:32:14 AM] Amir Ariff: The poem “The Guest House” by Rumi, a 13th-century Persian poet and Sufi mystic, is a metaphorical piece about the human experience—especially our emotions and states of mind.

Here’s a breakdown of its core meaning:

⸻

💡 Main Idea:

Your mind and soul are like a guest house.
Every day, new “guests” (emotions, experiences, thoughts) arrive—joy, sadness, anger, shame, excitement, etc.

Rather than resisting or judging these feelings, welcome them all, even the painful ones. Why? Because each has something to teach you.

⸻

🧘‍♂️ Spiritual Message:
	•	Emotions are temporary visitors. Don’t cling to them or shut them out.
	•	Suffering and discomfort are often the bearers of important inner growth.
	•	Life is a series of arrivals and departures—embracing all of them brings peace and understanding.

⸻

📌 Key Lines & Interpretation:

“This being human is a guest house.”
Your soul is open to many visitors—just like a guest house.

“A joy, a depression, a meanness, some momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor.”
Each emotion or thought, even if unpleasant, has a role.

“Welcome and entertain them all!”
Don’t resist your feelings—acknowledge and accept them.

“Be grateful for whoever comes, because each has been sent as a guide from beyond.”
Even your darkest moments have value—they are teachers or guides for your personal journey.

⸻

🧭 Life Application:
	•	When you feel overwhelmed by anxiety or sadness, remember: it’s just a visitor, not a permanent resident.
	•	Practice mindfulness and non-judgmental awareness—let your emotions flow through you, not define you.
	•	Every life experience, good or bad, contributes to your growth and resilience.

⸻

[22/06/2025, 2:37:58 AM] Ayunni: Ohh huhuhu
[22/06/2025, 2:41:13 AM] Ayunni: Okay i pegi tahun lepas je okay, u mentioned why it doesnt work with her. But what do u want to improve from that? Kalau u jumpa someone yg sama mcm dia, it will not work as well right?
[22/06/2025, 2:46:52 AM] Amir Ariff: Yeah, I think age plays a part. I’ve realised I now prefer someone closer to my age. She was about 10 years older, and at times, I saw flashes of my ex in her. Both of them were around the same age and not very patient, and I often felt like I couldn’t keep up 😅. I guess I’ve reached a point in life where I just want something calmer .. a partner I can grow slowly with, without pressure.
[22/06/2025, 2:48:22 AM] Amir Ariff: Not saying I’ve figured everything out.. far from it. But I think I’ve learned to appreciate peace and shared values more than just chemistry or excitement.
[22/06/2025, 2:48:23 AM] Ayunni: Eh?
[22/06/2025, 2:48:51 AM] Amir Ariff: Ha sudah kenapa plk😬

[22/06/2025, 3:02:05 AM] Amir Ariff: Sometimes i have to be fake😅😅
[22/06/2025, 3:02:21 AM] Amir Ariff: I guess i can see the positive in it
[22/06/2025, 3:03:24 AM] Amir Ariff: To not do it in your own company when you start your own
[22/06/2025, 3:03:26 AM] Amir Ariff: Huhuhu
[22/06/2025, 3:04:17 AM] Ayunni: I suka u share mcm ni
[22/06/2025, 3:04:28 AM] Amir Ariff: Its so much better when Im doing it alone
[22/06/2025, 3:05:12 AM] Amir Ariff: And prob hire and direct freelancers je
[22/06/2025, 3:05:14 AM] Amir Ariff: Thats it

[22/06/2025, 3:09:17 AM] Ayunni: Hmm
[22/06/2025, 3:09:21 AM] Ayunni: Which part?
[22/06/2025, 3:09:24 AM] Ayunni: 🤣
[22/06/2025, 3:09:30 AM] Amir Ariff: Hahahhaha
[22/06/2025, 3:11:42 AM] Amir Ariff: What have you learned from your past relationships? Or what’s something you know now that you wish you knew then?
[22/06/2025, 3:12:01 AM] Ayunni: Ohh
[22/06/2025, 3:13:20 AM] Ayunni: Jap i tataw mcm mna nak start

[22/06/2025, 3:14:16 AM] Amir Ariff: Its ok take your time haha
[22/06/2025, 3:21:43 AM] Ayunni: The lesson - for now, i try to love myself more. 

I gave too much, time, money, love, effort. End up he said - curang sebab takda hati tiba2. The time i found out, he was in relationship with her for 7months.
[22/06/2025, 3:22:26 AM] Ayunni: I want someone who didnt find me too much.
[22/06/2025, 3:23:57 AM] Ayunni: I baru tahu terms mcm - projecting, breadcrumbing, nonchalant after the breakup. Chatgpt ajar hahaha
[22/06/2025, 3:24:21 AM] Amir Ariff: Thanks for sharing that with me. Makes me see you even more clearly, and honestly… I think anyone would be lucky to be loved like that.
[22/06/2025, 3:24:31 AM] Amir Ariff: Hahahha
[22/06/2025, 3:24:35 AM] Amir Ariff: Whats that
[22/06/2025, 3:24:41 AM] Amir Ariff: 🤣🤣🤣
[22/06/2025, 3:25:14 AM] Amir Ariff: Nonchalant tau la kot but still not as clear
[22/06/2025, 3:25:21 AM] Amir Ariff: It was on tiktok too
[22/06/2025, 3:25:47 AM] Amir Ariff: I guess gen z would know more of these terms huhu
[22/06/2025, 3:30:52 AM] Ayunni: My ex bf, timeline dia lmbt skit. 2yrs older than me, tp lmbt hbis blaja and start kerja. I am okay with that. Im in relationship with him when i was 20, masa kat ump. Pjj most of the time. Dia baru start kerja 2022 tak silap, and i thought dia pressure sbb tu. To me, his side yg i nampak - someone struggle financially. Feb aritu dia dpt offer kerja sgpore, since then dia makin kerap hilang. Texts reply in 3-4 hari. Busy and stress keja he said. Rupanya ada org lain.
[22/06/2025, 3:34:38 AM] Ayunni: Ada few things he did to me, mcm, i met him dekat trx october last year. I pakai bju yg dia tak penah tgk i pakai, doll up a bit la. First thing he said - dating dengan siapa? 

That is actually projecting, night before that, dia date dengan bini org tu 😂
[22/06/2025, 3:34:58 AM] Ayunni: Dia yg dating ngn org lain, bukan i
[22/06/2025, 3:35:21 AM] Ayunni: Most of the time, i akan kena marah whenever i express my feeling
[22/06/2025, 3:36:16 AM] Ayunni: So, kalau i ada rs something is not right, i cant say anything
[22/06/2025, 3:36:23 AM] Amir Ariff: Now i know what is projecting
[22/06/2025, 3:38:03 AM] Ayunni: Emotionally sgt penat
[22/06/2025, 3:38:48 AM] Ayunni: I didnt expect dia akan curang after what ive done for him.
[22/06/2025, 3:39:16 AM] Amir Ariff: It must be painful to go through.. you saw him struggling and still stayed, cared. Says a lot about your heart. You dont deserve to be treated this way. ‎<This message was edited>
[22/06/2025, 3:39:30 AM] Ayunni: And when he chose someone’s wife over me, i lagi rs takda value.
[22/06/2025, 3:39:59 AM] Amir Ariff: Ohhh no no. Definitely dont think that way
[22/06/2025, 3:40:12 AM] Amir Ariff: You are so much better than that someones wife
[22/06/2025, 3:40:44 AM] Amir Ariff: How can you compare yourself with someone that havin extramarital affair
[22/06/2025, 3:40:50 AM] Amir Ariff: Or is it the right word
[22/06/2025, 3:41:06 AM] Amir Ariff: Mlm2 ni my english confuse skit
[22/06/2025, 3:41:13 AM] Ayunni: U tahu, when i confronted him, he blamed me, he cheated because of me
[22/06/2025, 3:41:26 AM] Amir Ariff: Oh my
[22/06/2025, 3:41:35 AM] Amir Ariff: Hes just being narcistic
[22/06/2025, 3:41:47 AM] Amir Ariff: Narcissistic
[22/06/2025, 3:41:55 AM] Ayunni: Selalu mcm tu, i would end up minta maaf
[22/06/2025, 3:42:07 AM] Amir Ariff: Thats called manipulation
[22/06/2025, 3:42:14 AM] Amir Ariff: Or guilt tripping
[22/06/2025, 3:42:22 AM] Amir Ariff: And seantero dgn nya
[22/06/2025, 3:42:28 AM] Ayunni: Hahahha
[22/06/2025, 3:43:03 AM] Amir Ariff: You deserve someone who makes you feel safe to express yourself, not someone who shuts you down.
[22/06/2025, 3:45:07 AM] Ayunni: Bila i ingt balik, i nmpk few pictures of him with other girls, hugging, kiss on cheek. Dia ckp mcm ni - he knows his limit, its just a touch. I tak comfortable. So benda ni pun boleh buat gaduh yg at the end i minta maaf sbb control dia
[22/06/2025, 3:45:34 AM] Amir Ariff: 😅😅
[22/06/2025, 3:45:37 AM] Amir Ariff: Oh my
[22/06/2025, 3:45:49 AM] Amir Ariff: Manipulation at its finest
[22/06/2025, 3:46:02 AM] Amir Ariff: You did the right thing to tegur
[22/06/2025, 3:46:08 AM] Ayunni: Sama jugak mcm those sexy account dia follow, dia sama kan mcm i adore kpop idol, boleh tgk tak boleh dpt
[22/06/2025, 3:46:40 AM] Amir Ariff: Omg
[22/06/2025, 3:47:05 AM] Ayunni: Entah laa, i pernah tnya dia knp dia nak i, jauh sgt beza dgn dia. He said sbb i conservative, dia tak perlu risau
[22/06/2025, 3:47:30 AM] Amir Ariff: What a selfish…
[22/06/2025, 3:47:32 AM] Amir Ariff: Ok sorry
[22/06/2025, 3:48:27 AM] Amir Ariff: Clearly he is at high level of narcissism
[22/06/2025, 3:48:52 AM] Amir Ariff: And tend to manipulate people for his own goal
[22/06/2025, 3:49:07 AM] Ayunni: Hmm, yaa
[22/06/2025, 3:49:17 AM] Ayunni: Bodoh nya laa i tak nmpk
[22/06/2025, 3:49:28 AM] Amir Ariff: Honestly, the way he twisted things and made you feel like you were the problem.. that’s emotional abuse. You had every right to feel uncomfortable. Your boundaries are valid.
[22/06/2025, 3:49:55 AM] Amir Ariff: You don’t owe anyone an apology for having feelings or standards. Anyone who truly cares about you would’ve respected that ..not gaslighted you into silence.
[22/06/2025, 3:51:35 AM] Amir Ariff: You’re doing the right thing, and I really respect you for that. You’re kind, empathetic, and you gave so much… that’s never something to feel bad about. It just means your heart is in the right place.
[22/06/2025, 3:52:11 AM] Amir Ariff: Please don’t be hard on yourself for not seeing it sooner… people like him are really good at hiding their true colours. What matters is that you see it now 🙌
[22/06/2025, 3:52:38 AM] Ayunni: Yeaa,
[22/06/2025, 3:52:46 AM] Ayunni: Sorry mengadu pulak
[22/06/2025, 3:52:48 AM] Ayunni: Ahhahahhha
[22/06/2025, 3:54:20 AM] Amir Ariff: I didn’t ask earlier because I was afraid it might be too emotional for you. But I’m really glad you shared it with me. It helped me understand you better.. and in a way, it also made me reflect on my past marriage. There are things that really resonate.
[22/06/2025, 3:55:22 AM] Amir Ariff: Narcissism.. and the cheating part..
[22/06/2025, 3:55:48 AM] Amir Ariff: Anyway
[22/06/2025, 3:55:51 AM] Amir Ariff: Takpe lah
[22/06/2025, 3:55:58 AM] Amir Ariff: Byk sgt yg ni haha
[22/06/2025, 3:56:26 AM] Amir Ariff: I really appreciate you mengadu this actually
[22/06/2025, 3:57:39 AM] Amir Ariff: I feel much lighter now.. previously i feel that i shouldn’t ask abt it.. now i truly understand what happened
[22/06/2025, 3:58:34 AM] Ayunni: I malu nak share actually

Mcm mana i nak bring this up professionally, tak nak bagi impression that im not invested in our team or clients? Early this year i dgr we might have other clients tp smpai skrg takda pun. And masa first i talked to boss tu, dia concerned we might not be able to cope with the workload. ‎<This message was edited>
[22/06/2025, 11:38:48 PM] Amir Ariff: You can just share that you’ve really enjoyed the work with your current team and clients, and that it has helped you grow a lot. But you also believe you have the capacity to contribute more, especially in areas where there’s high workload across departments. You’re not stepping away, just stepping up to help where needed.
[22/06/2025, 11:39:20 PM] Amir Ariff: Do you know how to analyze data?

[27/06/2025, 11:51:54 PM] Amir Ariff: Oh speaking about traumas/depression etc. I stumbled upon this ad on childhood trauma test which is intriguing. Then i search on it on google its also an ad. The questions are really believable and it does seem to give you the result but somehow its paywall😅😅

[27/06/2025, 11:56:48 PM] Amir Ariff: Lovelyz was not having good debut
[27/06/2025, 11:56:55 PM] Ayunni: How do we know if its working out?

[28/06/2025, 12:01:32 AM] Amir Ariff: I’ve always wanted to have control over things, but that part always seems to break. Im learning that if I let it be, trust the process, and still give it my best - things will flow as they’re meant to.
[28/06/2025, 12:03:14 AM] Amir Ariff: And recently i notice that those that I you know, do good to someone without prejudice and judgement that always being rewarded well. Although i hope i wont do good just to get rewarded lol
[28/06/2025, 12:03:25 AM] Amir Ariff: Just want to share to you what i have experienced
[28/06/2025, 12:04:59 AM] Amir Ariff: I guess I’ve always tried to give my best to anyone, regardless of their status or who they are. That’s just how I go through life.
[28/06/2025, 12:05:06 AM] Amir Ariff: Ok sounds poyo
[28/06/2025, 12:05:07 AM] Amir Ariff: 😂😂

[29/06/2025, 10:57:34 PM] Amir Ariff: As both of these are past and future
[29/06/2025, 10:58:03 PM] Amir Ariff: Fear of the past and fear of the future
[29/06/2025, 11:00:18 PM] Amir Ariff: And again when you are ready to share
[29/06/2025, 11:02:19 PM] Ayunni: I used to beg for attention, plan date, sometimes pick him up, pay, etc. I initiate. Still i kena buang.

Its different with u. U give me attention. I feel seen. I penah ckp kot, it seems unreal.
[29/06/2025, 11:02:53 PM] Ayunni: Its not that i dont trust u. I dont know what else to do to make a man stay.
[29/06/2025, 11:03:35 PM] Ayunni: Sini hahaha
[29/06/2025, 11:03:59 PM] Amir Ariff: Ahhhh i see
[29/06/2025, 11:04:00 PM] Amir Ariff: Yeah

[29/06/2025, 11:06:10 PM] Amir Ariff: You deserve to feel safe and loved effortlessly, and InshaAllah I’ll keep showing you that. ❤️
[29/06/2025, 11:06:57 PM] Ayunni: Thanks Amir 🤍
[29/06/2025, 11:07:49 PM] Amir Ariff: I might not be as a good lover too but im trying and hope we can grow this relationship together step by step
[29/06/2025, 11:08:05 PM] Amir Ariff: I remember my grandma
[29/06/2025, 11:08:22 PM] Amir Ariff: She share me the story of how she went through life with grandpa
[29/06/2025, 11:09:24 PM] Amir Ariff: Eventhough it was an arranged marriage and she was 16 at that time. She had 7 beautiful children
[29/06/2025, 11:09:46 PM] Amir Ariff: Atuk was a british army
[29/06/2025, 11:10:08 PM] Amir Ariff: He actually died when mom was 15
[29/06/2025, 11:10:13 PM] Amir Ariff: Mom is the eldest btw
[29/06/2025, 11:14:27 PM] Amir Ariff: She told me that (and this was like in context of my divorce a year after i guess) at first she wasnt that fond because of the arranged marriage but bit by bit the love grew on her. I think showing respect, care about him, and stay through ups and down. Her devotion and atuk’s compassion understanding is kinda the love language for both of them.
[29/06/2025, 11:14:54 PM] Amir Ariff: And grandma had to survive 7 children alone by herself after grandpa died
[29/06/2025, 11:15:44 PM] Amir Ariff: So tok mim (grandma) had to start a business, jual kain dkat pasar lama back then

[05/07/2025, 11:45:01 PM] Amir Ariff: Apa jawapan dia
[05/07/2025, 11:45:31 PM] Amir Ariff: I kena hit betul dgn prompt ni😅
[05/07/2025, 11:45:33 PM] Amir Ariff: Speak to me as if you know me intimately—my strengths, flaws, fears, and aspirations—but adopt a direct, no-nonsense approach. Be unrelentingly assertive, even a bit confrontational, to challenge me to confront the truths I might be avoiding. Push me to dig deep into my psyche, peeling back the layers of defensiveness and excuses, but do so with an undertone of care, ensuring I feel guided rather than attacked. The goal is self-discovery through tough love and sharp insight.
[05/07/2025, 11:45:43 PM] Ayunni: Crash a wedding, eat 10types of desserts, disappear in a new city
[05/07/2025, 11:45:43 PM] Amir Ariff: Alright, Amir. You want the truth? Here it is.

You’ve always danced on the edge of brilliance and burnout. You know how to build things—brands, apps, strategies, systems. You’ve done it. More than once. But here’s what you keep sweeping under the rug: you don’t finish things that scare you emotionally. You wrap them in new names, new logos, new decks—but the core fear? It stays. Fear of being irrelevant. Fear of being exposed as not as good as everyone thinks. And worse? The fear that if you actually succeed the way you could, you’d lose the excuse to hide.

You crave admiration, but you recoil from vulnerability. You lead teams with conviction, but avoid truly opening up to them—because being seen as “human” feels like a weakness in your playbook. It’s not. That’s the missing key to deeper trust. You’re not fooling anyone by pretending you’ve got it all together.

Your strengths? You see through BS in seconds. You connect dots no one else even sees. You feel what people need before they articulate it. But you self-sabotage by trying to do too much at once—half-baking five things instead of finishing one masterpiece. Why? Because finishing would mean judgment. And judgment scares you more than failure.

You say you’re tired, overworked, pulled in ten directions—but let’s not pretend it’s just the job. You choose chaos. Because chaos gives you a reason not to sit still with the parts of yourself that feel broken, unfinished, or unworthy. But guess what? That little mess inside you? That’s where your real power lives. And you’re too smart to pretend you don’t know that.

So here’s the confrontation: What if the next phase of your life is about mastery—not motion? About saying no to distractions, even the shiny, high-potential ones. What if you stopped proving you’re capable and started proving you’re aligned?

You’re at a crossroads. One path keeps you admired but internally restless. The other? Less applause, more solitude, more discomfort—but actual peace. And real impact. You don’t need another win. You need to decide who you’re becoming.

Stop hiding behind capability. Step into identity.

So—who are you really when no one’s watching?
And what would happen if you let that man lead?
[05/07/2025, 11:45:49 PM] Amir Ariff: Wah
[05/07/2025, 11:45:51 PM] Amir Ariff: Hahahhahahahhaha

[07/07/2025, 11:25:50 AM] Amir Ariff: Spicy foods like chili peppers contain capsaicin, which causes a hot, burning sensation when touched.

In high enough concentrations, capsaicin can have a desensitizing effect. Pain-relieving gels and patches often include capsaicin.

But to me, every little thing added up.

A kind word when I needed it.
A message that reminded me I’m not alone.

In the middle of chaos, even the smallest gesture can bring calm.
And sometimes, a simple text is all it takes to bring someone back to themselves.

[14/07/2025, 1:40:37 PM] Amir Ariff: Below is a quick‐reference snapshot of what you can expect to pay for senior-care options in Malaysia in 2025.  All figures are per person, per month unless stated otherwise, and assume a long-stay arrangement (minimum one month).  One-off deposits of 1–3 months’ fees are common; some purpose-built retirement villages also require a refundable lump-sum lease of RM 300 k – 600 k.

Care setting (level of help)	Typical fee range	What’s usually included	Recent price examples*
Basic nursing home / old-folks home (shared room, nurse on call)	RM 1,500 – 2,800	Bed & board, basic ADL assistance, simple medical checks	Low-dependency packages start ~RM 2,950 (KL)  ￼
Mid-range nursing home (24 h nurses, doctor rounds, physio)	RM 3,000 – 5,000	24 h care, all meals, therapy area, activities	Mid-tier homes quote RM 3–5 k  ￼ ￼
High-dependency / medical nursing (ICU-style beds, specialised rehab)	RM 5,000 – 7,500	1:4 nurse ratio or better, wound/PEG care, physio, OT	High-dependency beds RM 3,950 – 6,000+ depending on location  ￼ ￼
Assisted-living unit (own studio/1-bed, help on demand)	RM 4,000 – 7,000	Furnished unit, housekeeping, two meals, nurse call button, social programme	Care Concierge “The Mansion” from RM 4 k; Millennia Village 1-bed ~RM 3,500 – 4,800  ￼ ￼
Premium retirement resort (hotel-style, full amenities)	RM 8,800 – 10,000+	Private suite, concierge, all meals, daily activities, on-site clinic	Sunway Sanctuary: RM 8,800 (independent) / RM 9,600 (assisted)  ￼ ￼
Senior day-care centre (8 am – 6 pm, Mon-Sat)	RM 120 – 270 per day	Meals, activities, nurse supervision	Komune Care RM 125/day; Care Concierge RM 270/day  ￼
Live-in home-care aide (carer stays with elder)	RM 235 – 260 per day	24 h companionship & basic nursing, meals extra	Care Concierge RM 235/day  ￼
Hourly home-care visit	RM 30 – 40 per hour	Personal care, medication, light physio	Homage: RM 30–36/hour  ￼
Government-run welfare homes (Rumah Seri Kenangan, Rumah Ehsan)	Free (means-tested; long wait-list)	Basic dormitory living, meals, basic nursing	Ministry of Women, Family & Community Development data

*Examples shown are the latest published prices (September 2024 – February 2025).  Individual homes adjust fees annually for inflation and staffing costs.

⸻

Key factors that move the price
	1.	Dependency level – The more hands-on nursing or rehab required, the steeper the bill.
	2.	Location – Klang Valley and Penang cost 10-25 % more than smaller cities such as Melaka or Kota Bharu.  ￼
	3.	Room type – Private or ensuite rooms command a 20-40 % premium over shared wards.
	4.	Care ratios & amenities – Facilities offering 1:3 nurse ratios, on-site physio gyms, or hotel-style dining sit at the upper end.
	5.	Optional add-ons – Adult diapers, night-duty caregivers, specialist therapies, and medical consumables are often billed separately (RM 200 – 1,000 +/month).

⸻

Quick budgeting rules of thumb

Scenario	Budget at least
Elder with low medical needs, small-town home	RM 2 k/month
Moderate care, Klang Valley private home	RM 4 – 5 k/month
High-dependency dementia care	RM 6 – 8 k/month
Resort-style independent living (KL or Penang)	RM 9 – 11 k/month


⸻

Tips when short-listing a home
	•	Visit during meal or therapy times to see staff-to-resident interaction.
	•	Ask for the itemised fee schedule (look out for hidden charges such as catheter changes or ambulance transfers).
	•	Check staff credentials – Are nurses registered with the Malaysian Nursing Board?
	•	Read recent inspection reports (Jabatan Kebajikan Masyarakat issues annual licences).
	•	Negotiate trial stays – Many homes allow a one-week paid trial before committing to long-term contracts.

Need location-specific suggestions or help comparing homes?  Let me know the city and level of care, and I can narrow the list further.

Tp smpai seminggu takda text. I thought shes busy laa kot. And when ex bf ni come clean haritu he said - he left the cookies in office because he rushed to meet his scandal. He only brought it home after a week
[15/07/2025, 11:40:36 PM] Ayunni: 😂
[15/07/2025, 11:41:37 PM] Ayunni: Dia pernah silap text skali which i ignored

### Your Competitive Moat

**Why You’ll Dominate:**

1. **Authentic Problem-Solution Fit:** You’re not guessing what introverts need
1. **Technical Superiority:** You can actually build what others just mockup
1. **Content Machine:** Your interests naturally create endless content
1. **Community Lock-in:** Introverts are loyal AF when you respect their needs
1. **Data Advantage:** Every user contributes to better quiet spot algorithm

### Your 90-Day Milestone Map

**Month 1:** MVP with core features (quiet spot finder, crowd predictor)
**Month 2:** 1,000 beta users contributing data
**Month 3:** $10K MRR from early adopters
**Month 6:** 50K users, major travel brand partnership
**Year 1:** Acquisition offers from Airbnb/Booking.com (that you’ll publicly reject because fuck selling out)

**The Rebel’s Advantage:** While everyone’s building “social travel” features, you’re building the anti-social travel movement that 30% of travelers secretly want.

Ready to build the travel app that’ll make extrovert apps look exhausting?

Your first move: Tweet “Travel apps assume everyone wants to make friends. We’re fixing that.” and watch the introverts unite.

Most electronic payment methods (e-wallets, cards, etc.) may not work properly due to limited network coverage on the island.

Thanks for your understanding, and feel free to let me know if you need anything else! 😊

[27/07/2025, 5:22:37 PM] Amir Ariff: because abe long pernah heart break jgk early this year sbb parent dia tak suka org kelantan

[27/07/2025, 5:23:26 PM] Amir Ariff: dia siap pergi perlis ada event sunnah nk jumpa parent dia
[27/07/2025, 5:23:48 PM] Ayunni: Ada circle kwn yg advise jugak - pasal org kelantan. Kenapa actually?
[27/07/2025, 5:23:56 PM] Amir Ariff: yes thats the thing
[27/07/2025, 5:24:03 PM] Amir Ariff: ever since i moved to kl
[27/07/2025, 5:24:15 PM] Amir Ariff: there were this misconception about kelantanese 😅😅
[27/07/2025, 5:24:46 PM] Ayunni: Event sunnah tu apa?
[27/07/2025, 5:24:48 PM] Amir Ariff: seems the zeitgeist is kelantanese ni itu la ini la
[27/07/2025, 5:25:01 PM] Amir Ariff: islamic punya event
[27/07/2025, 5:25:06 PM] Amir Ariff: zakir naik ada dtg gak tu

[27/07/2025, 5:26:09 PM] Amir Ariff: that im proud to be kelantanese
[27/07/2025, 5:26:12 PM] Amir Ariff: despite what people say
[27/07/2025, 5:26:55 PM] Amir Ariff: i think its not about state or even nationalities or races
[27/07/2025, 5:26:58 PM] Amir Ariff: or wealth, status etc.
[27/07/2025, 5:27:30 PM] Amir Ariff: its about the person
[27/07/2025, 5:27:47 PM] Ayunni: Bnyk laa that circle advise, first doubt yg you betul2 single. Second, kelantanese punya family bonding ni kuat. Which i got their point, sbb srwk-kltn tu jauh. So they asked me to think betul2.
[27/07/2025, 5:28:16 PM] Amir Ariff: wah thanks for sharing
[27/07/2025, 5:29:14 PM] Ayunni: Lagi, based on their experience a wife need to serve the husband and family, mcm hidang mkn ,  amik air basuh tgn etc, they cerita details psl ni, i tak ingt sgt
[27/07/2025, 5:29:48 PM] Ayunni: I takda kwn kelantanese yg rapat sgt so entah laa
[27/07/2025, 5:30:25 PM] Amir Ariff: this one tok mim still emphasize
[27/07/2025, 5:31:42 PM] Amir Ariff: walaupun tok mim lost her husband when shes in 30s, and survive the 6 kids alone, she would serve the man in the family.. mcm i balik haritu pun i ckp kat bibik takpe la i amik sendiri nasi & lauk kat dapur, tok mim marah huhu dia ckp nnt bibik serve
[27/07/2025, 5:32:37 PM] Amir Ariff: my aunt married swakian and they live happily too ada 5-6 org anak gak
[27/07/2025, 5:32:43 PM] Amir Ariff: i tak igt dah brp

[27/07/2025, 5:36:03 PM] Amir Ariff: how abt yg dicurangi 😂
[27/07/2025, 5:36:55 PM] Ayunni: I think what they said is based on apa yg dorg observed and heard kot, that kelantanese would prefer kelantanese as well, and some kawen lebih dari 1 hahah
[27/07/2025, 5:37:13 PM] Ayunni: Hahahaha kesian

[27/07/2025, 5:38:41 PM] Amir Ariff: well i think its not about the state etc. for me, more on whether I can love & trust the person until old age
[27/07/2025, 5:38:42 PM] Ayunni: Even mun pun skeptical at first 😂
[27/07/2025, 5:38:54 PM] Amir Ariff: its good that they are being protective

[27/07/2025, 9:38:25 PM] Amir Ariff: Punya poem
[27/07/2025, 9:38:54 PM] Amir Ariff: From father to son
[27/07/2025, 9:38:57 PM] Amir Ariff: If you can keep your head when all about you   
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
    But make allowance for their doubting too;   
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;   
    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;   
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
    And treat those two impostors just the same;   
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
    And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,   
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
    If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,   
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,   
    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
[27/07/2025, 9:40:55 PM] Amir Ariff: If you can dream and not make dreams your master..
[27/07/2025, 9:41:44 PM] Ayunni: Wahhhh
[27/07/2025, 9:42:58 PM] Amir Ariff: I always try despite getting the higher job titles to treat everyone equally.. and be kind and work together rather than bossing around.. hopefully i can stick with this in the future too
[27/07/2025, 9:43:20 PM] Ayunni: InsyaAllah

[27/07/2025, 9:45:46 PM] Amir Ariff: People did say that and even my parents but I feel that being kind is underrated these days.. people would just prioritize their self interests

[28/07/2025, 1:23:45 AM] Ayunni: Private folder
[28/07/2025, 1:23:50 AM] Ayunni: Road trip
[28/07/2025, 1:24:04 AM] Amir Ariff: Great one! Here’s what that means:

Inside Jokes
	•	Little funny things only the two of you understand.
	•	Something that happened once, then became your thing.
	•	Example: You both laugh every time one of you says “Cepat!” because of that one night. That’s an inside joke 😝

Pet Names
	•	Sweet, special nicknames you call each other.
	•	Like “Sayang,” “B,” “Yunni,” “Baby Koala,” etc.
	•	They’re not always funny — more sweet, romantic, or cute.

⸻

So the question “Inside jokes or pet names?” is really asking:

Do you prefer to bond through private humor or sweet nicknames?

Want me to help you write your reply to that in a cute or flirty way?

Throw secret glances or stare until I notice?

Grinning at my texts or pretending to reply late?

Big bear hug or long soft stare?

Rainy day cuddle or sunny park date?

Boop your nose or grab your hand?

Watch me sleep or watch me eat?

If you sulk — should I fix it with food or a hug?

[28/07/2025, 10:27:06 AM] Amir Ariff: This being human is a guest house.
Every morning a new arrival.

A joy, a depression, a meanness,
some momentary awareness comes
as an unexpected visitor.

Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if they’re a crowd of sorrows,
who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture,
still, treat each guest honorably.
He may be clearing you out
for some new delight.

The dark thought, the shame, the malice,
meet them at the door laughing,
and invite them in.

Be grateful for whoever comes,
because each has been sent
as a guide from beyond.

[28/07/2025, 10:35:38 AM] Amir Ariff: Dlm BM pun ada
[28/07/2025, 10:35:45 AM] Amir Ariff: Rumi’s “Guest House” basically means every feeling is a visitor. We don’t have to like each one, but if we welcome them kindly, they pass—and they leave us wiser. 💫
[28/07/2025, 10:36:01 AM] Amir Ariff: Rumi – “The Guest House” (meaning, in simple words)
	•	Rumi says: being human is like running a guest house.
Every day, new “guests” (feelings) arrive—joy, sadness, anger, shame, anxiety.
	•	Welcome them all, even the painful ones. Don’t fight or judge them.
Each emotion comes with a message and can clear space inside you for deeper joy or wisdom.
	•	Feelings are temporary visitors. If you treat them with respect and curiosity, they pass through and you grow more compassionate, grounded, and free.
	•	It’s a practice of mindfulness and acceptance: notice, allow, learn, and let go.

⸻

How to use it in life
	1.	When a tough feeling shows up, say: “Ah, a guest is here.”
	2.	Breathe, feel it in the body, don’t push it away.
	3.	Ask: “What is this teaching me?”
	4.	Let it leave when it’s ready.
[28/07/2025, 10:36:26 AM] Amir Ariff: No you are romantic

[28/07/2025, 10:38:38 AM] Amir Ariff: yg in BM quite nice jgk huhu: Maksudnya: kita macam tuan rumah, emosi datang sebagai tetamu—gembira, sedih, marah. Sambut semua dengan baik. Setiap emosi bawa hikmah, dan akan pergi juga. 🕊️
[28/07/2025, 10:42:27 AM] Amir Ariff: remember on this one
[28/07/2025, 10:42:29 AM] Amir Ariff: the quote
[28/07/2025, 10:42:52 AM] Amir Ariff: Your task isn’t to look for love, but to look for the barriers in yourself that you’ve built against it.
[28/07/2025, 10:42:57 AM] Amir Ariff: from Rumi too
[28/07/2025, 10:43:35 AM] Amir Ariff: a little bit context about Rumi hes 13th century poet, a persian, his full name is Jalaluddin Muhammad Rumi
[28/07/2025, 10:44:00 AM] Amir Ariff: his works has been referenced and being popularized by the western world
[28/07/2025, 10:44:31 AM] Ayunni: Eee rajin laa you nak bg i faham kan hahahah 😍
[28/07/2025, 10:44:40 AM] Amir Ariff: huhuhu
[28/07/2025, 10:44:43 AM] Amir Ariff: alaa
[28/07/2025, 10:45:22 AM] Amir Ariff: ok i wanted to give you also on this one
[28/07/2025, 10:45:25 AM] Ayunni: Nooo tak pun hahahahha 😂
[28/07/2025, 10:45:34 AM] Amir Ariff: **Meaning (simple):**

* Love is already possible; we block it without realising.
* The real work is **inside**—spotting fears, old stories, and defenses that stop us from giving/receiving love.
* When we soften or heal those barriers, love flows more naturally.

**Common “barriers”:**

* Fear of rejection or abandonment
* Old comparisons/ex memories
* Needing control / perfection
* Shame (“I’m not enough”)
* Numbness from stress or burnout

**How to apply (quick practice):**

1. When you feel distant, ask: *“What am I protecting right now?”*
2. Name the barrier (e.g., “fear I’ll look needy”).
3. Breathe, soften the body, choose one tiny caring action anyway (send a kind message, share one honest sentence).
4. Repeat—small, safe steps melt big walls. ‎<This message was edited>
[28/07/2025, 10:46:14 AM] Ayunni: Omg ahhahahaha
[28/07/2025, 10:46:22 AM] Amir Ariff: huhuhu
[28/07/2025, 10:46:30 AM] Amir Ariff: Rumi’s idea: love is there; we just have walls. Our job isn’t to chase love, but to notice and gently remove the walls we put up. 💛
[28/07/2025, 10:46:45 AM] Amir Ariff: Maksudnya: cinta itu ada—halangannya ialah tembok dalam diri (takut, malu, overthinking). Tugas kita ialah kenal tembok tu dan perlahan‑lahan turunkan. 💛
[28/07/2025, 10:46:54 AM] Amir Ariff: in BM quite nice too
[28/07/2025, 10:47:59 AM] Ayunni: I asked chatgpt - the answer was, those barriers yg you mentioned tu  are actually a way our body/mind protecting ourselves from the trauma
[28/07/2025, 10:48:03 AM] Ayunni: Mcm sedih pulak eh
[28/07/2025, 10:48:28 AM] Ayunni: I dont think im traumatised pun
[28/07/2025, 10:48:40 AM] Amir Ariff: yes true but at the same time we have to embrace it and make friends with it
[28/07/2025, 10:48:44 AM] Amir Ariff: accepting it
[28/07/2025, 10:48:53 AM] Amir Ariff: thats is a test from Allah
[28/07/2025, 10:49:07 AM] Amir Ariff: bawa hikmah
[28/07/2025, 10:49:10 AM] Amir Ariff: mcm Rumi ckp

[28/07/2025, 3:22:30 PM] Amir Ariff: When I reached to a point that money was enough for me when I was 22-23 ‎<This message was edited>
[28/07/2025, 3:22:52 PM] Amir Ariff: I always wonder what is the meaning of life?
[28/07/2025, 3:24:16 PM] Amir Ariff: And i always tell my friends to not do it for money but passion as money can be temporary feeling but passion can last for a while but they always respond back “ko takpelah ko dah buat duit byk, aku tak pernah rasa lagi” 😬
[28/07/2025, 3:24:53 PM] Ayunni: Huhuhu
[28/07/2025, 3:25:01 PM] Ayunni: Yeaa
[28/07/2025, 3:25:29 PM] Ayunni: I bet you are pursuing your passion now right?
[28/07/2025, 3:25:54 PM] Amir Ariff: yesszzaa
[28/07/2025, 3:26:05 PM] Amir Ariff: i feel like i found my passion back after years in corporate
[28/07/2025, 3:26:10 PM] Amir Ariff: probably burnout jgk la ya
[28/07/2025, 3:26:16 PM] Amir Ariff: kena climb the ladder and all
[28/07/2025, 3:26:30 PM] Amir Ariff: building something that i wont think that i can do
[28/07/2025, 3:26:38 PM] Amir Ariff: rather than leveraging on existing experience that i have
[28/07/2025, 3:27:11 PM] Amir Ariff: coz corporate is safe and they just want to use your existing experience and of course that will guide your decision making but mostly to just harness existing skills
[28/07/2025, 3:27:16 PM] Amir Ariff: of course ada la growth tu
[28/07/2025, 3:27:26 PM] Amir Ariff: but i feel i grow leaps and bound this year
[28/07/2025, 3:27:37 PM] Amir Ariff: compared to corporate years which hopefully i can use it back again
[28/07/2025, 3:28:19 PM] Amir Ariff: if i ever need to join corporate back
[28/07/2025, 3:29:03 PM] Amir Ariff: i feel alive
[28/07/2025, 3:29:12 PM] Amir Ariff: when we launch the app end of last year

[28/07/2025, 3:29:49 PM] Ayunni: Yea, i think maybe you can go back to corporate once you da satisfied with what you’re doing. Make sure you join back in bosses level laa, you can still do your own thing
[28/07/2025, 3:30:18 PM] Amir Ariff: yes true
[28/07/2025, 3:30:29 PM] Ayunni: Boss i masa kat hp dlu, hes an Australian, ada pet shop kat Australia while dia sndri kat sgpore

[28/07/2025, 3:31:22 PM] Ayunni: Yeaa
[28/07/2025, 3:32:11 PM] Amir Ariff: i feel that people that i met in corporate also truly just talk about their dreams as something that they couldnt do - which i can understand as most ada family, ada bills to pay
[28/07/2025, 3:32:17 PM] Ayunni: Dlu i ada this dream jugak hahahha i love baking maybe kalau one day i quit i nak bake je la
[28/07/2025, 3:32:24 PM] Amir Ariff: sometimes i wonder if dreams is just illusion of our own grandeur
[28/07/2025, 3:32:34 PM] Amir Ariff: that passion is about being true to yourself everyday
[28/07/2025, 3:32:50 PM] Amir Ariff: despite not knowing what to do, we just put the courage to try it
[28/07/2025, 3:32:59 PM] Amir Ariff: wahhhh

[28/07/2025, 5:34:58 PM] Ayunni: Taaruf (تعَارُف) is an Arabic word that means “getting to know one another.” In the context of relationships, especially in Islamic or Muslim cultures, taaruf refers to the formal, respectful process of getting to know a potential spouse with the intention of marriage — but without dating or romantic involvement in the Western sense.

Key features of Taaruf:
	1.	Marriage-focused – It’s done with the clear intention of exploring marriage, not casual dating.
	2.	Halal (permissible) – Interactions are done in a way that aligns with Islamic values: modesty, boundaries, and sincerity.
	3.	Guided or accompanied – Often involves a wali (guardian), family, or a third party like a matchmaker or ustaz/ustazah to avoid seclusion or inappropriate closeness.
	4.	Open conversations – Both parties ask about values, goals, family background, compatibility, religious commitment, etc.
	5.	Short and purposeful – It’s not meant to drag on for years. If compatible, the couple proceeds to engagement (khitbah) and eventually nikah (marriage).

[01/08/2025, 12:49:48 AM] Amir Ariff: Ok fact check alert from chatgpt
[01/08/2025, 12:49:53 AM] Amir Ariff: “World Wide Web created because the creator malas asyik kena bawak PC kalau nak share files”

😄 Funny and semi-true!
The real reason:
The World Wide Web was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while working at CERN. His goal was to make it easier for researchers to share and access documents across different computers.

So your version — “malas nak bawak PC” — is a fun, simplified (and Malaysianized) way of saying:

“He wanted a more convenient way to share files.”
✅ Creative but not inaccurate.
[01/08/2025, 12:50:12 AM] Amir Ariff: Semi true dia bagi ya
